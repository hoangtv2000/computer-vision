# Computer vision

## Introduction to Computer vision
We introduce the theories and pratical results of Introduction to Computer vision subject's program by [attached document](https://github.com/hoangtv2000/computer-vision/blob/main/Introduction%20to%20Computer%20vision.ipynb). The subject has two major parts: Panorama stitching and Image segmentation (mid-level segmentation). 

## Advanced Computer vision
### 1. Image classification by Bag of visual words

**Steps**:
+ Use extract descriptors by SIFT descriptor 
+ Build a historgram of features by clustering descriptors 
+ Normalize features by its length
+ Take more part of a dataset for training. We train by SVM classifier
+ Take another part to predict. We archieve an acurracy: 65%


### 2. Tensorflow tutorials

Deep learning tutorials. 
+ Tensor, operations, operators
+ GPU acceleration
+ Check device
+ Linear layer, activation and model
+ Fully connected layers
+ Optimizations (gradient descent (GD), stochastic GD, GD with learning rate scheduling, GD with momemtum, Adam)
