# Computer vision

## Introduction to Computer vision
We introduce the theories and pratical results of Introduction to Computer vision subject's program by [attached document](https://github.com/hoangtv2000/computer-vision/blob/main/Introduction%20to%20Computer%20vision.ipynb). The subject has two major parts: Panorama stitching and Image segmentation (mid-level segmentation). 

## Advanced Computer vision
### Image classification by pack of visual words
[Code](https://github.com/hoangtv2000/computer-vision/blob/main/BoVW.ipynb)
**Steps**:
+ Use extract descriptors by SIFT descriptor 
+ Build a historgram of features by clustering descriptors 
+ Normalize features by its length
+ Take more part of a dataset for training. We train by SVM classifier
+ Take another part to predict. We archieve an acurracy: 65%
